<h3>Why build a space of anonymity about ourselves?</h3>

The main reason is the imperious need to represent ourselves in the almost infinite space of the Internet, when the personal becomes collective “it helps us to exist under the gaze of others”, we need to feel understood in the void of the immense, especially when the traditional collective spaces (church, union, family) seem to be less solid. In another sense, this search for validation is also a constant pressure: the feeling of being watched, the incessant competition with our peers, the comparisons with “influencers” and the factory of meticulously constructed images that they constitute, are just some of the examples of the problems of this new need for self-representation. In this context, the need for the alter ego is born, whether it is an avatar in Second Life, an account without a profile picture on Twitter or our personal account on Instagram.

<h3>We need someone else to relate to others through them, we need our reflection to distance ourselves from ourselves so as not to feel the pressure that “being” in the information age really demands of us.</h3>

This new constitution of our identity does not give rise to false identities far from us, nor does it simply turn us into the labels to which we adhere, but neither do we define ourselves only in a “radical” way through individual experiences or our participation in religious or political groups.We are now hybrids between what we are and our non-experiences, we do not sculpt ourselves through fiction or our reality but from the symbiosis of both social and cultural natures of the individual and the more actual subject.
