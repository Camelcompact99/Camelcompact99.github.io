 It is very difficult to find ourselves in this fast world, sometimes we do not seem to find ourselves in anything, and sometimes sometimes we can found us in  everything at once, sometimes we need an error, something that stops us long enough to be able to see the landscape,or our own emotional landscape. Turner's “Rain,Steam,Speed” seems today a providential work of how successive technological advances have diluted real space like loose brushstrokes on a canvas.

<h3>The world is spinning faster and faster, and the new ability to find ourselves anywhere and nowhere at the same time through a screen only blurs the lines that used to give us some kind of certainty about where our feet are standing.</h3>

Living in a world without certainties and through screens sometimes generates the need to create our own safe space. A landscape that exists, not as the representation of a material and tangible place, but as the delimitation of a comfortable plot within an intangible world that is incomprehensible and incomprehensible at a deep level, a network of comfort, a habitable space within the immense aridity of the post-digital era.
