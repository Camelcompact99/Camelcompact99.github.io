*...it must be understood that, nowadays seduction is what reduces inanity, the artificial what favors access to the real, the superficial what allows a greater use of reason. "*

**_Gilles Lipovetsky - "L'Empire de l'éphèmére"._**

We seem to be walking aimlessly since the wall fell, now everything is moving so fast that it seems static.In this speed I cannot even feel myself, I find myself in nothing and in everything at the same time. Sometimes I feel catharsis in the greatest trifles and an emptiness in the halls of arts, I think my spirit has died. I think the empire of reason has killed it, I think it has killed that of all of us.

Modernity since Thomas Hobbes and Robert Boyle has separated the human from the natural, has created a synthetic organization of the world that has denied us any other form of exaltation of the spirit than a radical knowledge of a “reality” that was still a fragile construction.

Since radical reason has ceased to be a great beacon that guides us and protects us from evil, since we have been abandoned in a desert of content and images, the need to recover a spiritual world becomes more evident.

<h3>The dialectics of the spectacle seek to activate the productive mechanics of our desire.</h3> The images that seduce us are transformative and have the capacity to construct spaces of existence.</h3>

The idea of an apparition that takes the forms coming from the spectacular framework seems to make more and more sense.</h3>

In a place as cold as this we must construct our own approaches to the ethereal, to the spiritual. The counterfeit synthesis processes by which the images of the “spectacle” web are constructed are the only thing that seems to be able to generate some kind of approach that will wound our over-stimulated sensibilities.

One of the many powers of the artist is to collect all these fragments to build or mediate a transcendental experience, that is the goal of the piece to create an aesthetic “appearance” through fragments of the desert of content in which we live.

She does everything to seduce me is an interactive installation that plays with the idea of apparition and pop culture, in it the vocals of the song yo voy by zion and lennox become more apparent within an ambient sound according to the amount of candles lit by the public, simulating an apparition.
